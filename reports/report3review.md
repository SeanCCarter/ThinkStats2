## Report 2 Review
### Review of [Designing the Optimal Employee Experience (For Employers' Wallets)](https://github.com/joeylmaalouf/HR-analytics/blob/master/report/report3.md) by Joey Maalouf

###### First Impressions:
I enjoy the satirical element, in which you frame it as recommendations for an unethical employer. However, I think that it might be improved by going all in on that premise, or framing it differently. Currently, there are only one or two satirical sentences, which means that the article itself is a little at odds with its own title.

###### Structure and Style
It was a good idea to put the first graph where it is. It makes it immediately clear what the overall results of the investigation were, and that the motivating question is "what makes employees stay where they are". One of the flaws comes from making it unclear exactly what the data provides - I don't know what a medium salary or a mid-level evaluation is, although I know now that the dataset didn't provide any fine grain detail on this.

I also worry about phrasing the later section as 'how can employers best optimize their employee conditions to minimize attrition rate while keeping costs low?' It isn't really an optimization problem, since we have no idea what costs are associated with the different factors that have been identified.

###### Other Notes:
- "talk about trends for each feature here, basically reference the feature coefficients"
- Didn't notice the footnote at first
- Maybe talk about number of projects - giving people more work is always free
