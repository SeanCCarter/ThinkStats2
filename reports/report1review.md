## Report 1 Review
### Review of [How do Europeans feel about Jewish, Muslim, and Gypsy immigration?](https://github.com/apurvaraman/DataScienceReport1/blob/master/ESS_immigration.md)

###### First Impressions:
I really liked the opening paragraph. It communicates the motivating question clearly, and the link to the data source was easy to see. I'm not quite as sure about the transition from the first paragraph to the analysis, though. It felt a little bit abrupt, and I think that not having already seen the graphs made it more difficult to go through the paragraph. The order I ended up reading it in was: first two paragraphs, Figure 1, other paragraphs, Figure 2.

###### Results, Interpretation, and Methodology
I think that for Figure 1, a CDF might not be the right representation. It's very difficult to interpret "cumulative frequency" vs. "many to none" without going through the rest of the article, especially the methodology section. One of the interpretations - the fact that favorability of all the groups trends together in most countries (interpretation, paragraphs 2 and 3) - doesn't seem to match this figure.

Most of the other results improvements would just be smaller, visual things. They do make a compelling argument to back up the interpretations, but some things are pretty hard to see. One example might the sorting in the larger graphs. It does make it easier to track a single country through all of the graphs, but the tradeoff is that it is more difficult to get a feel for the overall distribution of views towards immigrants. Another is the y axis lable - a positive bar means that country is *less* likely to prefer immigrants - at first glance, Hungary looks very welcoming.

The methodology section is really solid. There were clear explanations of what data the survey contained, what data was considered unimportant, and why those values were discarded. It also made the reasons for these graphs pretty clear.

###### Miscellaneous
- There is a (I don't think so?) at the bottom of Interpretation/analysis
- Some of the graphs have blank space on the left hand sides
- 
- I don't actually know very many country abreviations.
