###### First Impressions:
I really liked the opening paragraph. It communicates the motivating question clearly, and the link to the data source was easy to see. I'm not quite as sure about the transition from the first paragraph to the analysis, though. It felt a little bit abrupt, and I think that not having already seen the graphs made it more difficult to go through the paragraph. The order I ended up reading it in was: first two paragraphs, Figure 1, other paragraphs, Figure 2.
